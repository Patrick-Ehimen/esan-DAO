# Solidity Governance Project

This project implements a decentralized governance system using Solidity and OpenZeppelin contracts. It includes a governance token, a governance contract, a timelock controller, and a simple storage contract.

## Components

### 1. GovToken (`src/GovToken.sol`)

A governance token implemented using OpenZeppelin's `ERC20`, `ERC20Permit`, and `ERC20Votes`. This token is used for voting in the governance system.

### 2. MyGovernor (`src/MyGovernor.sol`)

A governance contract that allows token holders to create and vote on proposals. It extends various OpenZeppelin governance contracts such as `Governor`, `GovernorSettings`, and `GovernorVotes`.

### 3. TimeLock (`src/TimeLock.sol`)

A timelock controller that enforces a delay between when proposals are made and when they can be executed, enhancing the security of the governance process.

### 4. Box (`src/Box.sol`)

A simple contract that allows storing and retrieving a value. It is used to demonstrate how a governed contract might function.

## Setup and Deployment

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have foundry installed. Then run:

```bash
   forge install
```

2. **Compile Contracts:**
   Compile the Solidity contracts using Foundry:

```bash
forge build
```

## Security

This project uses OpenZeppelin contracts which are industry standard and audited. However, always ensure to audit and test your specific implementation thoroughly before deploying to a production environment.

## Setup and Deployment

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
````

2. **Compile Contracts:**
   Compile the Solidity contracts using Hardhat:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

3. **Deploy Contracts:**
   Deploy the contracts to a local or test Ethereum network:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
   ```

4. **Verify Contracts:**
   After deployment, verify the contracts on Etherscan by running:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat verify --network <network-name> DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
   ```

## Usage

- **Mint GovTokens:**
  Mint governance tokens to allow users to participate in the governance process.

  ```solidity
  govToken.mint(userAddress, amount);
  ```

- **Create Proposals:**
  Propose changes or actions by specifying the target contract, values, and calldata.

  ```solidity
  myGovernor.propose(targets, values, calldatas, description);
  ```

- **Vote on Proposals:**
  Vote on active proposals using the governance tokens.

  ```solidity
  myGovernor.castVote(proposalId, support);
  ```

- **Execute Proposals:**
  Once a proposal has passed and the timelock delay has elapsed, execute the proposal.
  ```solidity
  myGovernor.execute(targets, values, calldatas, descriptionHash);
  ```
